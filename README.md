# Shazam Filter
> A Python program to filter recognized songs from unrecognized songs.

## Installation

To be able to actually use this, you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/). Make sure that "Add to path" is enabled while installing.

Now you'll need to install some dependencies, open up Powershell or CMD and type in the following command.

```pip install shazamio```

Finally, download this repository (Click "Code" and then "Download ZIP") and extract it. Copy all the songs to the "songs" folder (If it doesn't exist, create it.), then in Explorer go to the root of the extracted folder and type in ```powershell``` or ```cmd``` in the address bar at the top.

Then run the following command.

```python main.py```

Then sit back, relax, and wait for it to all be sorted.

Once its done, look in the output.txt if you want to know what the recognized songs were.

## Issues

If you have any, feel free to make an Issue.

This took me like 10 minutes to make so it is not polished at all.
